# Rubiks Cube
This was a winter break project. It is not optimized. It is only the bare bones. This was more of a brain excersise than a coding challenge, thus it uses the human rubiks cube approach rather than a mathematically founded algorithm

It's pretty boring when you run it (I didn't want to make a GUI or anything) but when you run the code, the program will initialize a  cube of dimension X dimension size and it will scramble it with purely random moves. This is NOT just a reverse algorithm (scramble then do the opposite). This solver uses the standard beginner solving method (I am not a rubiks  cube expert, so it's not that creative).
