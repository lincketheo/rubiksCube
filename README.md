## Main method is in /target/libs/{jar file}

run main file

```bash
    $ ./run <DIMENSION> <SCRAMBLE>
DIMENSION = cube dimension
SCRAMBLE = number of scramble moves
```
Pretty boring runner. I know, not really  interested in UI


# Rubiks Cube
This is a virtual rubiks cube. It's pretty boring when you run it (I didn't want to make a GUI or anything) but when you run the code, the program will initialize a  cube of dimension X dimension size and it will scramble it with purely random moves. This is NOT just a reverse algorithm (scramble then do the opposite). This solver uses the standard beginner solving method (I am not a rubiks  cube expert, so it's not that creative).
